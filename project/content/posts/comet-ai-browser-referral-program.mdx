## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Learn from others' mistakes to maximize your success.

### Quality Issues

**Mistake #1: Promoting to Unengaged Audiences**

❌ **Wrong**: Posting referral links in random Facebook groups

✅ **Right**: Target specific communities interested in productivity, AI, or browser technology

**Mistake #2: Using Misleading Claims**

❌ **Wrong**: "Make $10,000/month with this one trick!"

✅ **Right**: "I earn $200-500/month sharing Comet with my network"

**Mistake #3: Spamming Referral Links**

❌ **Wrong**: Posting your link 10 times per day on Twitter

✅ **Right**: Share valuable content with natural link placement

### Technical Mistakes

**Mistake #4: Sharing Generic Links**

Always use YOUR unique referral link from Dub.co dashboard. Generic links earn you nothing.

**Mistake #5: Not Tracking Performance**

Use UTM parameters, check dashboard weekly, and analyze which content converts best.

**Mistake #6: Forgetting Disclosure**

Always disclose affiliate relationships: "This is my referral link - you get 1 month free, I earn a commission"

### Compliance Issues

**Mistake #7: Violating Platform Terms**

Check subreddit rules, YouTube policies, and Facebook group guidelines before posting.

**Mistake #8: Making Unrealistic Income Promises**

Be honest about earning potential and variability based on effort and network size.
