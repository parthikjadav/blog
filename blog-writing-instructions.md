5. Primary keyword usage

```markdown
## Introduction

React hooks revolutionized how we write React components. If you're 
struggling with class components or want to write cleaner, more 
maintainable code, this React hooks tutorial is for you.

In this comprehensive guide, you'll learn how to use useState and 
useEffect hooks, create custom hooks, and follow industry best 
practices. By the end, you'll be able to build production-ready 
React applications using modern hook patterns.

Let's dive in.
```

### 3.3 Main Content Sections
**STRUCTURE**: Each major section should follow this pattern:

```markdown
## Section Title (H2 with keyword)

[Brief overview - 50 words]
Explain what this section covers.

### Subsection 1 (H3)

[Explanation - 100-200 words]
Detailed explanation with examples.

**Key Points**:
- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
- Bullet point 3

```code example```

**Real-World Example**:
[Practical application - 100 words]

### Subsection 2 (H3)

[Continue pattern...]
```

### 3.4 Code Examples (CRITICAL)
**RULES**:
- Include code examples for technical posts
- Add comments explaining complex parts
- Show both correct and incorrect approaches
- Include output/result when relevant
- Use syntax highlighting

```markdown
### useState Hook Example

Here's how to use the useState hook in a functional component:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

function Counter() {
  // Declare state variable with initial value of 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**What's happening here**:
- `useState(0)` initializes count to 0
- `setCount` is the updater function
- Clicking the button increments the count

❌ **Common Mistake**:
```jsx
// Don't mutate state directly
count = count + 1  // Wrong!
```

✅ **Correct Approach**:
```jsx
// Use the setter function
setCount(count + 1)  // Right!
```
```

### 3.5 Visual Elements (REQUIRED)
**RULE**: Include visual elements every 300-400 words

- Screenshots
- Diagrams
- Infographics
- Code output images
- Comparison tables

```markdown
![React Hooks Lifecycle Diagram](/images/hooks-lifecycle.png)
*Figure 1: Visual representation of React hooks lifecycle*

| Hook | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| useState | Manage state | Component needs local state |
| useEffect | Side effects | API calls, subscriptions |
| useContext | Share data | Avoid prop drilling |
```

### 3.6 Conclusion Section (REQUIRED)
**COMPONENTS**:
1. Recap main points (3-5 bullets)
2. Reinforce key takeaway
3. Call-to-action
4. Related resources

## 4. Writing Style Guidelines

### 4.1 Professional Yet Conversational Tone
**BALANCE**: Sound authoritative while remaining approachable

✅ **CORRECT**:
```
React hooks simplify state management in functional components. 
Instead of writing class components with lifecycle methods, you 
can now use hooks to achieve the same functionality with less code.

Let's explore how this works in practice.
```

❌ **TOO FORMAL**:
```
The utilization of React hooks facilitates the implementation of 
state management paradigms within the context of functional 
component architectures, thereby obviating the necessity for 
class-based component structures.
```

❌ **TOO CASUAL**:
```
Yo, React hooks are super cool! They're like, way better than 
those old-school class components. You're gonna love 'em!
```

### 4.2 Active Voice (PREFERRED)
**RULE**: Use active voice 80% of the time

✅ **Active Voice**:
```
React introduced hooks in version 16.8.
You can create custom hooks to share logic.
Developers prefer hooks over class components.
```

❌ **Passive Voice** (use sparingly):
```
Hooks were introduced by React in version 16.8.
Custom hooks can be created to share logic.
Hooks are preferred over class components by developers.
```

### 4.3 Sentence Structure
**GUIDELINES**:
- Average sentence length: 15-20 words
- Mix short (5-10 words) and medium (15-25 words) sentences
- Avoid sentences over 30 words
- Use transition words (however, therefore, additionally)
- Break complex ideas into multiple sentences

✅ **GOOD**:
```
React hooks are powerful. They enable functional components to use 
state and lifecycle features. Previously, you needed class components 
for this functionality. Hooks changed everything.
```

❌ **TOO COMPLEX**:
```
React hooks, which were introduced in version 16.8 and have since 
become the preferred method for managing state and lifecycle features 
in functional components, have fundamentally changed how developers 
approach React development by eliminating the need for class components 
in most scenarios.
```

### 4.4 Paragraph Length
**RULES**:
- 2-4 sentences per paragraph
- Maximum 100 words per paragraph
- Use white space generously
- Break up long blocks of text

### 4.5 Readability Targets
**REQUIREMENTS**:
- Flesch Reading Ease: 60-70 (fairly easy to read)
- Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: 8-10
- Avoid jargon without explanation
- Define technical terms on first use

---

## 5. Content Quality Standards

### 5.1 Word Count Guidelines
**MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS**:
- Tutorial posts: 1500-2500 words
- How-to guides: 1000-1500 words
- Listicles: 1200-2000 words
- Opinion pieces: 800-1200 words
- News/updates: 500-800 words

### 5.2 Depth and Detail (CRITICAL)
**RULE**: Provide comprehensive coverage

**For Each Topic, Include**:
1. **Definition**: What it is
2. **Purpose**: Why it matters
3. **How it works**: Technical explanation
4. **Examples**: Practical demonstrations
5. **Use cases**: When to apply
6. **Best practices**: How to do it right
7. **Common mistakes**: What to avoid
8. **Alternatives**: Other approaches

### 5.3 Accuracy and Fact-Checking
**REQUIREMENTS**:
- Verify all technical information
- Test all code examples
- Cite sources for statistics

---

## 6. Human-Written Quality Indicators

### 6.1 Natural Language Patterns
**INCORPORATE**:
- Contractions (don't, can't, you'll)
- Rhetorical questions
- Personal pronouns (you, we, I)
- Conversational transitions
- Varied sentence beginnings

```markdown
You've probably wondered why React hooks are so popular. Here's 
the thing: they solve real problems. They make your code cleaner. 
They're easier to test. And they're simpler to understand.

But here's what most tutorials won't tell you...
```

### 6.2 Personality and Voice
**ADD**:
- Occasional humor (when appropriate)
- Personal anecdotes
- Industry observations
- Relatable analogies
- Empathy for reader challenges

```markdown
I remember when I first learned React hooks. I was confused. 
Why replace something that worked? But after building a few 
projects, I got it. Hooks aren't just different—they're better.

Think of hooks like upgrading from a flip phone to a smartphone. 
Sure, both make calls, but one makes life so much easier.
```

### 6.3 Engagement Elements
**INCLUDE**:
- Questions to the reader
- Challenges/exercises
- "Pro tips" callouts
- Warning boxes
- Success stories

```markdown
**Pro Tip**: Always initialize state with the correct data type. 
If you need an array, use `useState([])`, not `useState()`.

⚠️ **Warning**: Don't call hooks inside loops or conditions. 
This breaks React's rules and causes bugs.

💡 **Quick Exercise**: Try creating a custom hook that fetches 
data from an API. Share your solution in the comments!
```

# How to Use React Hooks: Complete Beginner's Guide 2025

## Introduction

React hooks transformed how developers write React applications. If you're 
tired of class components or want to write cleaner, more maintainable code, 
you're in the right place.

**Quick Answer**: React hooks are functions that let you use state and other 
React features in functional components. The two most common hooks are 
`useState` for managing state and `useEffect` for side effects like API calls.

In this comprehensive guide, you'll learn:
- What React hooks are and why they matter
- How to use useState and useEffect hooks
- How to create custom hooks
- Best practices and common mistakes to avoid

Let's dive in.

## What Are React Hooks?

React hooks are special functions that let you "hook into" React features 
from functional components. Introduced in React 16.8, hooks enable you to 
use state, lifecycle methods, and other React features without writing 
class components.

**Key characteristics**:
- Functions that start with "use" (useState, useEffect)
- Only work in functional components
- Must be called at the top level (not inside loops or conditions)
- Enable code reuse through custom hooks

Before hooks, you needed class components for state management:

```jsx
// Old way - Class component
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { count: 0 }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Increment
        </button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

With hooks, the same component becomes much simpler:

```jsx
// New way - Functional component with hooks
import { useState } from 'react'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The difference is clear: less boilerplate, easier to read, and simpler to maintain.

---

## Why Use React Hooks?

React hooks solve several problems that plagued class components:

### 1. Simpler Code

Hooks eliminate the need for `this` keyword, constructor functions, and 
binding methods. Your components become pure functions that are easier 
to understand.

### 2. Better Code Reuse

Custom hooks let you extract component logic into reusable functions. 
No more complex patterns like higher-order components or render props.

### 3. Easier Testing

Functional components with hooks are simpler to test. You can test logic 
separately from UI rendering.

### 4. Smaller Bundle Size

Hooks result in smaller bundle sizes compared to class components because 
they minify better.

**Real-world impact**: According to [React's official documentation](https://react.dev), 
teams report 20-30% reduction in code when migrating from classes to hooks.

---

## Understanding useState Hook

The `useState` hook is your primary tool for managing component state.

### Basic Syntax

```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue)
```

**Parameters**:
- `initialValue`: The starting value for your state

**Returns**:
- `state`: Current state value
- `setState`: Function to update the state

### Simple Example

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

function TextInput() {
  const [text, setText] = useState('')

  return (
    <div>
      <input 
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Type something..."
      />
      <p>You typed: {text}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Multiple State Variables

You can use `useState` multiple times in a single component:

```jsx
function UserProfile() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('')
  const [age, setAge] = useState(0)
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('')

  return (
    <form>
      <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
      <input value={age} onChange={(e) => setAge(e.target.value)} />
      <input value={email} onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} />
    </form>
  )
}
```

**Pro Tip**: For related state values, consider using a single state object:

```jsx
const [user, setUser] = useState({
  name: '',
  age: 0,
  email: ''
})

// Update specific field
setUser(prev => ({ ...prev, name: 'John' }))
```
